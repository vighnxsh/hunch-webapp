# Search

> The search endpoint lets you intelligently search the web and extract contents from the results. 

By default, it automatically chooses the best search method using Exa's embeddings-based model and other techniques to find the most relevant results for your query. You can also use Deep search for comprehensive results with query expansion and detailed context.

                    complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities
                    is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While
                    there are abundant AI models available for different domains
                    and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks.
                    Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
                    exceptional ability in language understanding, generation,
                    interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act
                    as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve
                    complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic
                    interface to empower t

                    HuggingGPT is a framework using ChatGPT as a central
                    controller to orchestrate various AI models from Hugging
                    Face to solve complex tasks. ChatGPT plans the task, selects
                    appropriate models based on their descriptions, executes
                    subtasks, and summarizes the results. This approach
                    addresses limitations of LLMs by allowing them to handle
                    multimodal data (vision, speech) and coordinate multiple
                    models for complex tasks, paving the way for more advanced
                    AI systems.
